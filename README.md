# CS-NEA-AERO
Aerofoil tester using a fluid simulation and shape drawer

Currently have a (seemingly) functional LBM simulation, along with an aerofoil drawer. 



TODO:
Add main menu
Something seems to be up with fluid simulation, but may be due to broken aerofoil loading
  ^ also may be due to aerofoil sections being given a velocity in setup. I'll have to do some investigating
Fix aerofoil saving (after drawing) (currently on average, half the aerofoil is saved/loaded (semi-intentionally)
