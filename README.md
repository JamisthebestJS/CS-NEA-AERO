# CS-NEA-AERO
Aerofoil tester using a fluid simulation and shape drawer

Currently have a (seemingly) functional LBM simulation, along with an aerofoil drawer. 



TODO:
finish menu stuff:
- sim settings
- propulsion device menu (link up buttons)
add propulsion device sims:
- add a way to use preset simulations (internal boundary shape and conditions) for prop devices
add unit conversions:
- calculator to convert from inputted SI units to sim units
- calculator to convert from ouputted sim units force to newtons

add settings calculator:
- calculator to calculate density from given temperature and altitude (with assumtions listed in writeup)
- calculator to calculate likely air temperature given a density (assuming an altitude of 12200m and ^^ assumptions)
