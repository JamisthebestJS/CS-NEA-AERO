# CS-NEA-AERO
Aerofoil tester using a fluid simulation and shape drawer

Currently have a (seemingly) functional LBM simulation, along with an aerofoil drawer. 



TODO:
Finish menu stuff
Add sidebar to aerofoil drawing
Fix aerofoil saving (after drawing) (currently on average, half the aerofoil is saved/loaded (semi-intentionally)
